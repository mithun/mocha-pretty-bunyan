# mocha-pretty-bunyan 
## description

bunyan is a pretty nice package to log in json format, and provides an awesome cli to display it in human readable way.

**But**, when you run your test with mocha, you cannot take benefit  of the cli, so you then get raw json logs that is a mess to read.

*mocha-pretty-bunyan* provides a mocha reporter *Spec*  (by default) that display bunyan with a pretty/human readble format in the context of the mocha default reporter.

## Install

```
npm install mocha-pretty-bunyan --save-dev
```

## Usage

```
mocha --reporter mocha-pretty-bunyan
```

## example of output:

```
